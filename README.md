GitHub Repo for my HOIV [German Atmosphere Uncut MK2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2919668293) mod. This is a re-release of my [German Atmosphere Uncut](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2778072691) that was removed from the Steam Workshop.

*This mod has a Nazi theme, so if you are politically correct &/or easily offended... or it's illegal in your country... simply do not download it. You control your own happiness.

Combines the best of the following mods and re-releases them after their removal from Steam: Hitler Maintheme, German Background, German Wallpapers & German Atmosphere.

Tired of the bland and boring main menu image? This mod changes the main menu and adds a new main theme with a speech by Adolf Hitler.
Need more loading screens? This mod increases the standard loading screen background images with 29 new wallpapers.
Need even more music to conquer the world to? This mod supports the historical atmosphere with speeches and documentaries of the Deutsche Wochenschau and known persons. (A LITTLE OVER 4:34:44 WORTH OF PURE HISTORICAL AMBIENCE)
